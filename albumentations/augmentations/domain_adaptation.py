class HistogramMatching(ImageOnlyTransform):
    """Implements histogram matching, a technique that adjusts the pixel values of an input image
    to match the histogram of a reference image. This adjustment ensures that the output image
    has a similar tone and contrast to the reference. The process is applied independently to
    each channel of multi-channel images, provided both the input and reference images have the
    same number of channels.

    Histogram matching serves as an effective normalization method in image processing tasks such
    as feature matching. It is particularly useful when images originate from varied sources or are
    captured under different lighting conditions, helping to standardize the images' appearance
    before further processing.

    Args:
        reference_images (Sequence[Any]): A sequence of objects to be converted into images by `read_fn`.
            Typically, this is a sequence of image paths.
        blend_ratio (Tuple[float, float]): Specifies the minimum and maximum blend ratio for blending the matched
            image with the original image. A random blend factor within this range is chosen for each image to
            increase the diversity of the output images.
        read_fn (Callable[[Any], np.ndarray]): A user-defined function for reading images, which accepts an
            element from `reference_images` and returns a numpy array of image pixels. By default, this is expected
            to take a file path and return an image as a numpy array.
        p (float): The probability of applying the transform to any given image. Defaults to 0.5.

class FDA(ImageOnlyTransform):
    """Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA) for simple "style transfer" in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation
    (UDA). FDA manipulates the frequency components of images to reduce the domain gap between source
    and target datasets, effectively adapting images from one domain to closely resemble those from another without
    altering their semantic content.

    This transform is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the training (source) and testing (target) images
    come from different distributions, such as synthetic versus real images, or day versus night scenes.
    Unlike traditional domain adaptation methods that may require complex adversarial training, FDA achieves domain
    alignment by swapping low-frequency components of the Fourier transform between the source and target images.
    This technique has shown to improve the performance of models on the target domain, particularly for tasks
    like semantic segmentation, without additional training for domain invariance.

    The 'beta_limit' parameter controls the extent of frequency component swapping, with lower values preserving more
    of the original image's characteristics and higher values leading to more pronounced adaptation effects.
    It is recommended to use beta values less than 0.3 to avoid introducing artifacts.

    Args:
        reference_images (Sequence[Any]): Sequence of objects to be converted into images by `read_fn`. This typically
            involves paths to images that serve as target domain examples for adaptation.
        beta_limit (float or tuple of float): Coefficient beta from the paper, controlling the swapping extent of
            frequency components. Values should be less than 0.5.
        read_fn (Callable): User-defined function for reading images. It takes an element from `reference_images` and
            returns a numpy array of image pixels. By default, it is expected to take a path to an image and return a
            numpy array.

    Example:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import albumentations as A
        >>> image = np.random.randint(0, 256, [100, 100, 3], dtype=np.uint8)

        >>> result = aug(image=image)

    Note:
        FDA is a powerful tool for domain adaptation, particularly in unsupervised settings where annotated target
        domain samples are unavailable. It enables significant improvements in model generalization by aligning
        the low-level statistics of source and target images through a simple yet effective Fourier-based method.

class PixelDistributionAdaptation(ImageOnlyTransform):
    """Performs pixel-level domain adaptation by aligning the pixel value distribution of an input image
    with that of a reference image. This process involves fitting a simple statistical transformation
    (such as PCA, StandardScaler, or MinMaxScaler) to both the original and the reference images,
    transforming the original image with the transformation trained on it, and then applying the inverse
    transformation using the transform fitted on the reference image. The result is an adapted image
    that retains the original content while mimicking the pixel value distribution of the reference domain.

    The process can be visualized as two main steps:
    1. Adjusting the original image to a standard distribution space using a selected transform.
    2. Moving the adjusted image into the distribution space of the reference image by applying the inverse
       of the transform fitted on the reference image.

    This technique is especially useful in scenarios where images from different domains (e.g., synthetic
    vs. real images, day vs. night scenes) need to be harmonized for better consistency or performance in
    image processing tasks.

    Args:
        reference_images (Sequence[Any]): A sequence of objects (typically image paths) that will be
            converted into images by `read_fn`. These images serve as references for the domain adaptation.
        blend_ratio (Tuple[float, float]): Specifies the minimum and maximum blend ratio for mixing

        read_fn (Callable): A user-defined function for reading and converting the objects in
            `reference_images` into numpy arrays. By default, it assumes these objects are image paths.
        transform_type (str): Specifies the type of statistical transformation to apply. Supported values
            are "pca" for Principal Component Analysis, "standard" for StandardScaler, and "minmax" for
